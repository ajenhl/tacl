This is a text that serves as a test for splitting a text into
multiple parts based on simple rules involving non-regular expression
matching of substrings. The definition of a part consists of at least
one rule, and may have as many rules as needed. Entire substrings may
be marked as an element of a part, or for long sections a unique start
string and unique end string may be specified, with everything in
between also being included in the part.
