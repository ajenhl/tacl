TACL
====

tacl is a tool for performing basic text analysis on the texts
available from the `Chinese Buddhist Electronic Text Association`_
(CBETA). It is largely generic, however, and can operate with minor
modifications on other corpora.

The code is developed at https://github.com/ajenhl/tacl/ and the
documentation is available at http://tacl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/


Installation
------------

Using `Python 3`_ (minimum version 3.3), run ``python setup.py
install``. Requires `SQLite`_ and `lxml`_ XML library.


Usage
-----

Run ``tacl -h`` for a listing of available subcommands, and ``tacl
<subcommand> -h`` for help on a specific subcommand.
