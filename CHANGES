2.1.0  2015-06-27  Jamie Norrish  <jamie@artefact.org.nz>

  * Added zero-fill option to tacl report, supplying result rows with
    a count of zero to witnesses of a text that has at least one
    witness with a non-zero count.

  * Added collapse-witnesses subcommand to tacl-helper, to collapse
    result rows for witnesses to the same text with the same count
    into a single row.

  * Fixed a bug in tacl report's extend if the same witness is
    associated with more than one label in the results.

  * Added check for texts being relabelled in a catalogue file.

  * Added check for only a single label being supplied to a query.


2.0.0  2015-05-27  Jamie Norrish  <jamie@artefact.org.nz>

  * Added support for multiple witnesses to a text. Witnesses are
    automatically extracted from the CBETA texts, and results now
    include a 'siglum' field indicating which witness of the text a
    result comes from.

  * Added total count of n-grams occurrences per text to 'tacl search'
    results.

  * Split 'tacl strip' into 'tacl prepare' and 'tacl strip'.

  * Reimplemented supplied queries to be more useful and not have
    hidden gotchas.

  * Fixed a bug causing 'tacl stats' to sometimes return incorrect
    results.


1.1.0  2014-05-27  Jamie Norrish  <jamie@artefact.org.nz>

  * Added a tacl align command, to output aligned sequences of
    intersections between all pairs of differently labelled texts in a
    set of results.

  * Added LICENCE and CHANGES to MANIFEST.in.


1.0.2  2014-05-20  Jamie Norrish  <jamie@artefact.org.nz>

  * Added install_requires to setup.py, so that installation via pip
    installs the dependences.


1.0.1  2014-05-20  Jamie Norrish  <jamie@artefact.org.nz>

    distribution.
