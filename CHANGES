2.0.0  2015-05-27  Jamie Norrish  <jamie@artefact.org.nz>

  * Added support for multiple witnesses to a text. Witnesses are
    automatically extracted from the CBETA texts, and results now
    include a 'siglum' field indicating which witness of the text a
    result comes from.

  * Added total count of n-grams occurrences per text to 'tacl search'
    results.

  * Split 'tacl strip' into 'tacl prepare' and 'tacl strip'.

  * Reimplemented supplied queries to be more useful and not have
    hidden gotchas.

  * Fixed a bug causing 'tacl stats' to sometimes return incorrect
    results.


1.1.0  2014-05-27  Jamie Norrish  <jamie@artefact.org.nz>

  * Added a tacl align command, to output aligned sequences of
    intersections between all pairs of differently labelled texts in a
    set of results.

  * Added LICENCE and CHANGES to MANIFEST.in.


1.0.2  2014-05-20  Jamie Norrish  <jamie@artefact.org.nz>

  * Added install_requires to setup.py, so that installation via pip
    installs the dependences.


1.0.1  2014-05-20  Jamie Norrish  <jamie@artefact.org.nz>

  * Added a MANIFEST.in to explicitly include README.rst in the
    distribution.
